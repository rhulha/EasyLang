# The easy programming language

## Introduction
This project is an interpreter for the strongly typed programming language easy
The interpreter is written in Java.
The project also includes an easy IDE complete with auto completion.

## Motivation
I always loved Java, but I did see some areas that could be improved, at least back in 2012.
And I always wanted to create my own language and learn what it takes to do so.
And let me tell you the first time everything comes together and your interpreter runs your language is exhilarating.
This is in fact the second language I created after [RayScript](https://github.com/rhulha/RayScript).
But RayScript was dynamically typed and therefore lacked auto completion.

And since I wanted to teach my kids programming I felt that auto completion was critical.
So I created this new statically typed programming language.
